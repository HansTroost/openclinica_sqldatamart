/* 
    Makes a snapshot of all study data, exported as SAS sas7bdat files.
    Comment out the %INCLUDE command if you want the snapshot script for 
    the nominated study but don't want to run it yet.
    
    Set the following 4 variables. 
    Use forward slashes in paths. If the paths contain 2 or more consecutive spaces,
    comment out the %INCLUDE and manually re-add the spaces to the paths before
    running. SAS compresses these spaces out, even with COMPRESS=NO.
    1. filter_study_name_schema= name of study schema to snapshot.
        e.g. "MY STUDY" would have a schema named: my_study
    2. snapshotdir: file path to put snapshot files in
    3. odbc_string_or_file_dsn_path= the filedsn=path or odbc=string to connect with
    4. data_filter_string: Optional. SQL appended to each SELECT command. 
        Applied to itemgroup tables only. Some examples:
      - Get data only for subjects enrolled before date 2014-01-01:
        LEFT JOIN study_schema_name.subjects AS subj USING (subject_id) WHERE subj.subject_enrol_date < $$2014-01-01$$::date
      - Get data only if it was entered into events named SCR, BL, W4, W8:
        WHERE event_name IN ($$SCR$$,$$BL$$,$$W4$$,$$W8$$)
       SAS can send filters with single or dollar quoting for strings.
